# QuizGen AI

This project contains two versions of the Quiz Application:
1. **React Web App** (Runs in the browser preview automatically)
2. **Python Streamlit App** (Runs in a terminal)

## How to run the React App
If you are in a web container (like Project IDX, StackBlitz, etc.), the React app should be running automatically in the preview window. 

## How to run the Python Streamlit App
If you want to run the Python version, open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).
